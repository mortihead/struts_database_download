Struts 1 do not support put and delete http methods. So i`m added /Download, /Delete and /Main Paths for appropriate actions.
Config file is config.xml in root directory.
Simple download and hibernate logs are stored in a slf4jlogback.log
I believe that the source file is valid and do not process possible errors...
